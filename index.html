							<a href="images/fulls/01.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/01.jpg" alt="Several students, two shown fully, working from laptops and books at a library table. The table is covered with various school supplies and snacks." /></a>
							<h2>Hardly Working</h2>
							<p>Don't let them fool you. Five minutes earlier they were throwing skittles at eachother.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/02.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="An outdoor hallway with stone columns on one side and glass panes on the other. Sunlight is shining inbetween the columns, and you can see a tree through the end of the hallway." /></a>
							<h2>Tunnel Vision</h2>
							<p>This was my first time in this part of campus and the light coming through the gaps of the tunnel caught my eye.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/03.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/03.jpg" alt="The picture is pointed upward at a large brick building with white columns and the words 'graduate school' on it. There is a closed yellow umbrella in the bottom left corner."/></a>
							<h2>Sunbrella</h2>
							<p>It was raining an hour before I took this picture, believe it or not.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/04.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/04.jpg" alt="The picture is taken through a hanging red ring and pointed up towards the sky. Through the ring you can see the bars of apparatus it is hanging from and trees." /></a>
							<h2>In the Loop</h2>
							<p>In my experience, the new workout course in Pritchard has always been used for fun rather than working out.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/05.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/05.jpg" alt="A large flower with many small yellow-green petals and Hokie Stone in the background." /></a>
							<h2>Look Closely</h2>
							<p>These flowers were in full bloom, contrasting the wilting ones all around.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/06.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/06.jpg" alt="A HokieBird painted against a white background on the pavement." /></a>
							<h2>Underfoot</h2>
							<p>The HokieBird can be found just about anywhere on campus. I almost overlooked this one that I walk past daily.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/07.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/07.jpg" alt="An up-close picture of a bike tire and spokes, with more bikes sitting in the background." /></a>
							<h2>Gear Up</h2>
							<p>This picture portrays one of the more common modes of transportation around campus.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/08.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/08.jpg" alt="A picture aimed upward at a curved Hokie Stone building against a blue sky" /></a>
							<h2>Nice Curves</h2>
							<p>Newman Library shines against the bright blue sky.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/09.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/09.jpg" alt="A picture of the corner of the curved underside of a bridge built from concrete and Hokie Stone." /></a>
							<h2>Get Over It</h2>
							<p>Professor Evia told me not to take the same "beeping" picture of the Torgersen bridge. So I didn't.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/10.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/10.jpg" alt="A picture pointed upward at tree branches, with a blue sky in the background." /></a>
							<h2>Look Up</h2>
							<p>On this day, the leaves on the trees were hanging somewhere inbetween summer and fall as they were not quite all green, but not yet completely yellow.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/11.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/11.jpg" alt="A picture taken aiming down a plant bed and a large brick building with glass windows and columns to the side." /></a>
							<h2>A Little Sideways</h2>
							<p>Squires is landmark for all Virginia Tech students, but no one is quite sure if its notoriety comes from the delicious food it holds or the endless activities it hosts.</p>
						</article>
						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/fulls/12.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/12.jpg" alt="A glass skylight in the shape of a pyramid coming out of the ground." /></a>
							<h2>The Great Pyramids of VT</h2>
							<p>These pyramids bring light into the architectural studios. You can take a peak through the glass panes to see a multitude of students hard at work.</p>
